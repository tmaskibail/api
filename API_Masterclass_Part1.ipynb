    "## Access APIs via Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with a simple exercise to ge familiar with two fundamental API concepts: [1] RESTful web services and [2] \"JSON\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### The API request\n",
    "\n",
    "*Info:* Basically, every web service is an API and almost all RESTful web services (common architectual pattern) use HTTP as transportlayer. We can therefore call these services with a normal browser and have a look at how the service responds. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenWeatherMap is a web service that provides weather related data including forecasts. A typical API request could look like like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?APPID=21d450d89671b5620fe0a6d091d263f5&q=paris,fr&units=metric\n",
    "\n",
    "This http based request is built from a base URL, a method and parameters. If we take a closer look at the URL, we discover several elements in our request:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the base URL of the API: **http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/**\n",
    "2. the method of the API we call: **/weather**\n",
    "3. the parameters with which we call the method: \n",
    " - The API key with which we authenticate ourselves: **APPID=21d450d89671b5620fe0a6d091d263f5**\n",
    " - The query we use to specify the location: **q=paris,fr**\n",
    " - The parameter to get metric results: **units=metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Info:* If you would like to learn more about this particular API and possible parameters, have a look at their [Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/current#data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK:** Please click on the link now to get the current weather in Berlin: \n",

    "*Info:* The format above is called JSON. It is a simple, structured and human readable file format for exchanging data objects between applications.

The value of an attribute might be text or a number. However, an attribute can also contain another object as value.\n",
